I currently work as a Substance Use Disorder Medicaid Data Analyst at the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services. I am a formally trained epidemiologist and avid R user. I am interested in open source software development and its intersection with public health. 

This website serves as my personal portfolio and blog. I post about anything that interests me. Posts tagged 'R' are cross posted to [R-bloggers.](https://www.r-bloggers.com/)
