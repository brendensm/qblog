Recently, I started a new position that requires me to use a Windows computer (I miss my MacBook Air dearly). This has led me to learn about the subtle differences when using R on different operating systems.

If you are like me, you probably work with a team and handle confidential data. Many workplaces use network drives to store data securely. Often in my day-to-day work, I use files with increasingly complex file paths and read them into RStudio. If you are familiar with this process, you likely know how particular R can be about file path formatting.

R prefers file paths to be separated by forward slashes `/`. The default file paths in Windows, however, use backward slashes `\`. You *could* manually change each backward slash to a forward slash, *or* add another backward slash so that each folder is separated by two slashes. While both options work most of the time, if you do this often enough, there's a more efficient solution!

## A Function to Simplify Your Workflow

To avoid this hassle, I use a custom function to quickly import and format my file paths:

```{r}
# install.packages("clipr")
copied_path <- function(){
  out <- clipr::read_clip() # or readClipboard on Windows
  out <- gsub("^\"|\"$", "", out)
 # out <- gsub("\\\\", "/", out)
  clipr::write_clip(out) # writeClipboard(out)
  message("The formatted path has been copied to your clipboard.")
  return(out)
}
```

::: callout-note
I am using functions from the R package `clipr` because I wrote this blog post on a MacBook Air. On a Windows machine, I would use the functions `readClipboard` and `writeClipboard` from the `utils` package to avoid an additional dependency.
:::

Let's say I have a complex file path like this: "my\\file\\is\\in\\here\\somewhere.txt". I would first copy this to my clipboard from the file explorer. On a Windows machine, this copies the full path including quotation marks. When we run our function in the console, the following occurs:

```{r}
#| eval: false
copied_path()
```

![](cp_output.jpg)

This returns the neatly formatted file path and automatically copies it to your clipboard, saving you time and effort.

## How the Function Works

In R, we can read what is copied to our clipboard. This is the first step in our function. We can call it as a string using the following command:

```{r}
#| eval: false
out <- clipr::read_clip()
# or readClipboard() on Windows
```

When we copy a file path from the file explorer on a Windows machine, it includes quotation marks. Therefore, the next step is to remove these from the string using regex:

```{r}
#| eval: false
out <- gsub("^\"|\"$", "", out)
```

We can then replace double back slashes with a forward slash. If we don't do this, the string copied to our clipboard will retain single back slashes:

```{r}
#| eval: false
out <- gsub("\\\\", "/", out)
```

For the final step, we copy the new string to the clipboard, send a message to the console, and return the new string:

```{r}
#| eval: false
  clipr::write_clip(out) # writeClipboard(out)
  message("The formatted path has been copied to your clipboard.")
  return(out)
```

## Another Alternative

If you are using R version 4.0.0 or later, you also have the option of [using a raw string constant](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14185287/escaping-backslash-in-string-or-paths-in-r/14185627#14185627). This is done by wrapping your text with `r"()"`. This will return a string with double back slashes:

<button onclick="loadApp()" class="btn btn-primary" id="loadButton" style="background:#685068;">Subscribe to my Newsletter!</button>

<div id="myapp"></div>

<script>
let isLoaded = false;

function loadApp() {
  const container = document.getElementById("myapp");
  const button = document.getElementById("loadButton");
  
  if (!isLoaded) {
    // Create and add the iframe
    const iframe = document.createElement('iframe');
    iframe.src = "https://n1mbmu-brenden-smith.shinyapps.io/listserv/";
    iframe.width = "100%";
    iframe.height = "275px";
    iframe.style.border = "none";
    container.appendChild(iframe);
    button.textContent = "Hide App";
    isLoaded = true;
    container.style.display = "block";
  } else {
    // Toggle visibility of existing iframe
    if (container.style.display === "none") {
      container.style.display = "block";
      button.textContent = "Hide App";
    } else {
      container.style.display = "none";
      button.textContent = "Subscribe to my Newsletter!";
    }
  }
}
</script>
