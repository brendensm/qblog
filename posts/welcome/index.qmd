## Hi hello!

This is hard for me to do! I've been wanting to start blogging for some time now. This whole website is only possible because of the wonderful blog posts by [Bea Milz](https://beamilz.com/posts/2022-06-05-creating-a-blog-with-quarto/en/) and [Alber Rapp](https://albert-rapp.de/posts/13_quarto_blog_writing_guide/13_quarto_blog_writing_guide.html#create-your-first-blog-post). A huge huge thank you to them both. Their posts demonstrate how easy it is to get up and running with a Quarto blog!

Inspired by their words, there is no better time to start writing. So consider this a first introduction. I am setting the intention to post monthly to this blog.

## So who am I?

My name is Brenden Smith. At this point, I am a little over a year into my graduate studies. I attend Michigan State University and I am working towards my Master in Public Health. I am most interested in data analysis, visualization, community-engaged research, and health disparities.

Public health as a field can be very broad. By its very nature, the field is multidisciplinary and covers a wide array of topics. I come from primarily a policy background. I received my Bachelor of Arts in social relations and policy from James Madison College (also here at MSU). My senior seminar was focused on US health care and policy and pretty much ever since I've been interested in a career in PH.

During my undergrad I was also introduced to R for the first time in a quantitative methods course. That introduction began my interest in the programming language. More recently I have discovered the tidyverse and shiny packages. It is so exciting to be a part of the open-source community. I hope to contribute to it as I have most definitely benefited from the wealth of knowledge already available on the internet.

## What will I post?

To start, I think I will document certain projects I've taken on that relate to data analysis and visualization. I consider myself a beginning to intermediate level R user. To help me retain the information I'm learning, I will try to blog everything that seems worth sharing. I hope that these help you, if you are trying to learn more about R like I am.

I don't want my posts to be exclusive to R. Like any tool, the language has its strengths and weaknesses. I will likely include some content on PowerBI and perhaps its integration with R. I also want to document notable takeaways from my experiences in graduate school and other projects I am involved with in my professional work.
