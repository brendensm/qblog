This whole website is only possible because of the wonderful blog posts by Bea Milz and Alber Rapp. A huge huge thank you to them both. Their posts demonstrate how easy it is to get up and running with a Quarto blog!\nInspired by their words, there is no better time to start writing. So consider this a first introduction. I am setting the intention to post monthly to this blog."

I consider myself a beginning to intermediate level R user. To help me retain the information I’m learning, I will try to blog everything that seems worth sharing. I hope that these help you, if you are trying to learn more about R like I am.\nI don’t want my posts to be exclusive to R. Like any tool, the language has its strengths and weaknesses. I will likely include some content on PowerBI and perhaps its integration with R. I also want to document notable takeaways from my experiences in graduate school and other projects I am involved with in my professional work."

    "text": "This post is intended to demonstrate some basic ways to map data in R. For our example, we will be creating a choropleth map of Michigan’s counties featuring COVID-19 data. The result is something quite similar to the map featured on the state’s dashboard. The data used in this post is from October 4, 2022.\nFor the sake of practice, we will walk through two different ways to go about this process. First we will use ggplot2. We will use a function called map_data to pull in shape file data easily. In our second example, we will use leaflet to create a better looking version of this map and use a raw shape file."

    "text": "So who am I?\nMy name is Brenden Smith. At this point, I am a little over a year into my graduate studies. I attend Michigan State University and I am working towards my Master in Public Health. I am most interested in data analysis, visualization, community-engaged research, and health disparities.\nPublic health as a field can be very broad. By its very nature, the field is multidisciplinary and covers a wide array of topics. I come from primarily a policy background. I received my Bachelor of Arts in social relations and policy from James Madison College (also here at MSU). My senior seminar was focused on US health care and policy and pretty much ever since I’ve been interested in a career in PH.\nDuring my undergrad I was also introduced to R for the first time in a quantitative methods course. That introduction began my interest in the programming language. More recently I have discovered the tidyverse and shiny packages. It is so exciting to be a part of the open-source community. I hope to contribute to it as I have most definitely benefited from the wealth of knowledge already available on the internet."

First, as always, we load in the libraries we will be using.\n\n\nCode\n# Load packages -----------------------------------------------------------\nlibrary(tidyverse) # really just dplyr but the whole verse can't hurt\nlibrary(openxlsx) # to read in excel data\nlibrary(plotly) # for the interactive part\nlibrary(RColorBrewer) # to set our color palette\n\n\nNext, we will get our county map. To do this we can simply call the function map_data and specify that we want it at the county level. This will give us data for every county in the US. Because we are only mapping Michigan, we add a second line to subset our first data frame ‘counties’ to only include Michigan.\n\n\nCode\n# Make the base state map -------------------------------------------------\ncounties <- map_data(\"county\")\nmi_county <- subset(counties, region == \"michigan\")\n\n\nFor our COVID-19 data, I am importing an older file from state’s website (linked previously). If you want a current version to follow along, you can find it there. Once the file is loaded into R Studio, we need to make a few adjustments. The original file splits the cases into two categories, confirmed and probable. On the state’s dashboard, they combine these numbers into a total for map reporting. We will do the same. This is easily done with the group_by and summarise functions. We will also change the county names to lowercase in preparation for merging.\n\n\nCode\n# Data prep ---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nmicovid <- read.xlsx(\"Cases and Deaths by County 2022-10-04.xlsx\")\n\nmicovid <- micovid %>%\n  group_by(COUNTY) %>%\n  summarise(total_cases = sum(Cases),\n            total_deaths = sum(Deaths)) %>%\n  ungroup() %>%\n  mutate(subregion = tolower(COUNTY))\n\ncases_and_county <- inner_join(mi_county, micovid, by = \"subregion\")\ncases_and_county <- cases_and_county %>%\n  rename(county = COUNTY)\n\n\n\n\nCode\ncases_and_county<- cases_and_county %>%\n  mutate(Category = case_when(total_cases < 1000 ~ '0-999', \n                              total_cases < 5000 ~ '1000-4999',\n                              total_cases <15000 ~ '5000-14999',\n                              total_cases < 30000 ~ '15000-29999',\n                              total_cases < 100000~ '30000-99999',\n                              total_cases < 1000000 ~ '100000+',\n                              TRUE ~ 'NA'))\n\ncases_and_county$Category <- as.factor(cases_and_county$Category)\n\nlvls <- c('0-999', \n          '1000-4999',\n          '5000-14999',\n          '15000-29999',\n          '30000-99999',\n          '100000+')\n\ncases_and_county$Category <- fct_relevel(cases_and_county$Category, lvls)\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Making the map ----------------------------------------------------------\n\np <- c(\"#ACD1E7\", \"#82BADC\", \"#59A1CF\", \"#236893\",\"#174562\", \"#122548\")\n\nlabel <- list(\n  bgcolor = \"#EEEEEE\",\n  font = list(color = \"black\")\n)\n\nnoax <- list(\n  title = \"\",\n  zeroline = FALSE,\n  showline = FALSE,\n  showticklabels = FALSE,\n  showgrid = FALSE\n)\n\ng <- cases_and_county %>%\n  ggplot(aes(long, lat, \n                group = group,\n                text = paste('</br>County:', county, '</br>Category:', Category,\n                             '</br>Cases:', total_cases)))+\n  geom_polygon(colour = alpha(\"black\", 1/2), fill = NA) +\n  geom_polygon(data = cases_and_county, colour = \"black\", aes(fill = Category))+\n  theme_void() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = p) \n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplotly(g, tooltip = c(\"text\"), width = 700, height = 600) %>%\n  layout(xaxis = noax,\n         yaxis = noax) %>%\n  style(hoverlabel = label) %>%\n  config(displayModeBar = FALSE)"

After learning some of the ins and outs of exporting and transforming data, formatting beautiful visualizations came surprisingly easy.\nThe dashboard featured here is a re-imagining of the State’s current COVID-19 dashboard. I began with recreating the content they already provide. This entire project was made using the publicly available data files on the SOM’s website. In the last tab, I incorporated the CDC’s community level data that they provide for each state. I included this as the data provided is made comparable by population standardization, and increasingly, it seems that officials are looking to these levels specifically for policy guidance.\nTo view the dashboard in full screen you can use the link here. Below is the embedded dashboard. Enjoy!"

I recently reread my copy of Maggie Nelson’s Bluets and felt inspired to revisit an older project of mine. Possibly the first R project I put together (that was more fun, and not statistics or graphic related) was my twitter bot, everywordisblue.\nThis was a year or so back when I was just starting to dust off R and commit to learning the language fully. The original account was influenced by many of the silly bots on the website and my personal passion for the color blue. It took a randomly selected noun, pasted the word 'blue' in front of it, and posted it straight to Twitter once a day. While this creation gave me some immediate satisfaction (and some interesting results), I did feel that the account was a bit too simplistic; I always wanted to do more.\nInfinitely more satisfying would be a randomly selected hue of blue, shared daily, completely automated. To do this required editing my original script and, most importantly, web-scraping a data set of blue colors with accompanying hex codes. Follow along and let’s build something fun!"

    "section": "Using ‘rvest’",
    "text": "Using ‘rvest’\nTo help us source our data, the library 'rvest' provides everything we need. In order to create a data frame containing the color name and the hex code, we need to:\n\nimport the web search’s html\npull out the two elements from the code (name, hex code)\nthen repeat this process for each of the 89 pages\n\nThe function 'read_html' from rvest makes the first step incredibly easily. For this, we simply pass in the web address as an argument in the function and save the output as a new value called 'page'.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(rvest)\nlink <- \"https://www.color-name.com/search/blue\"\npage <- read_html(link)\n\n\nNext, we’ll pass 'page' into the function 'html_nodes' and then into 'html_text' to extract the desired string vector. The text passed through 'html_nodes' must be sourced from the webpage you are scraping from. You can use the ‘inspect’ feature in Google Chrome, or the Chrome extension ‘SelectorGadget’ to find the proper tag to use.\n\n\nCode\nname <- page |> html_nodes(\"h2 a\") |> html_text()\nhex <- page |> html_nodes(\".hx\") |> html_text()\n\n\nOnce that is done, we can take both vectors and create a data frame.\n\n\nCode\ncolors <- data.frame(name, hex, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)\n\n\nIn order to collect each page of data, it is easiest to use a for loop. For this we make a couple of changes. First, we will create an empty data frame titled 'colors' to store data in for each iteration of the loop. Because there are 89 pages, we set the for loop to iterate that many times. We store this as 'page_result' in the loop and change the url to match what is displayed on each page number then use 'paste0' to put them together. Lastly, I added 'rbind' to add the new rows to the 'colors' data frame and a print command to keep track of the loop progress.\n\n\nCode\ncolors <- data.frame()\n\nfor (page_result in 1:89){\n  \n  link <- paste0(\"https://www.color-name.com/search/blue/page/\", page_result)\n  \n  page <- read_html(link)\n  \n  name <- page |> html_nodes(\"h2 a\") |> html_text()\n  hex <- page |> html_nodes(\".hx\") |> html_text()\n  \n  colors <- rbind(colors, data.frame(name, hex, stringsAsFactors = FALSE))\n  \n  print(paste(\"Page:\", page_result))\n}\n\n\nAnd as a last step, I decided to clean up the colors a bit. Even though the search used the key word 'blue', I noticed that the last page displayed colors that did not have the word 'blue' in the title. To fix this, I filtered out any color that did not contain the word.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(dplyr)\nblues <- colors |> filter(grepl('Blue', name))"

HHP data shows national trends for varying mental illnesses while the UDS data speaks to the experience of patients accessing care at federally qualified health centers throughout the country. We added this data and compared it with poverty rates across U.S. counties (American Community Survey) and mental health provider shortage levels (Area Health Resources Files).\nMy favorite part of this challenge was getting to create large, interactive maps to explore these data.\nWhile the application could be embedded here, it is best viewed in its own window.

Therefore, we should not compare these counties against each other without considering population size differences.

    "text": "Time to Plot!\nFrom here, we can start our first plot. I will select my target counties using the filter() function that comes from the dplyr package. Be sure to specify which aesthetics you want to plot on the respective axes. Here we are putting the variable Year on the x-axis and Opioid Overdose Deaths on the y.\n\nopdeaths %>%\n  filter(County %in% counties) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = `Opioids Overdose Deaths`)) +\n  geom_line()\n\n\n\n\nOh no! What happened? We didn’t tell ggplot which lines we wanted to see. It is important that within the layer geom_line() we specify that we want to plot different lines based on our county variable. To do this, we simply add an aes() layer and assign color to County.\n\nopdeaths %>%\n  filter(County %in% counties) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = `Opioids Overdose Deaths`)) +\n  geom_line(aes(color = County))\n\n\n\n\nThat looks a lot better! But we can do more. The lines look a bit skinny to me. I would like them to stand out more. It also might help to adjust the opacity of the lines. This can make points that cross over easier to read. To make these changes, we can specify linewidth and alpha in geom_line() outside of the aes() argument.\nI think it would be great to add points to our plot, too. Like the geom_line() layer, I want these to be large enough and overlap easily. I will pass through similar arguments in the geom_point() layer, also specifying the color.\n\nopdeaths %>%\n  filter(County %in% counties)  %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = `Opioids Overdose Deaths`)) +\n  geom_line(linewidth = 1, alpha = 0.8, aes(color = County)) +\n  geom_point(size = 2, alpha = 0.8, aes(color = County))\n\n\n\n\nLastly, I want to add labels and theme to really polish up our plot. This is surprisingly easy! To add our labels, we add another layer called labs(). Here we can add a proper title, and more accurate labels for the axes.\nAdding a theme is even easier. We can quickly add on a layer and pick a theme that we like. For my example, I’m using the fivethirtyeight theme that comes from ggthemes. Be sure to check out the other options available in this package.\nAfter our theme_fivethrityeight() layer, I’m adding a general theme() layer to specify that I want all my main title and axes titles to be shown. I am also adjusting the text size to make the title a bit more readable.\n\nopdeaths %>%\n  filter(County %in% counties)  %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = `Opioids Overdose Deaths`)) +\n  geom_line(linewidth = 1, alpha = 0.8, aes(color = County)) +\n  geom_point(size = 2, alpha = 0.8, aes(color = County)) +\n  labs(title = \"Opioid Overdose Deaths in Michigan's Capital Area \\nCounties, 1999 – 2020\",\n       x = \"Year\",\n       y = \"Number of Deaths\") +\n  theme_fivethirtyeight() +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 16),\n        plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n        axis.title = element_text(size = 12),\n        axis.text = element_text(size = 11),\n        axis.title.y = element_text(vjust = +3),\n        axis.title.x = element_text(vjust = -0.75),\n        text = element_text(family = \"Georgia\"),\n        plot.margin = unit(c(1, 1, 1, 1), \"lines\"))\n\n\n\n\nAnd just like that, we have a very nice looking line chart!"
