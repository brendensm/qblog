This whole website is only possible because of the wonderful blog posts by Bea Milz and Alber Rapp. A huge huge thank you to them both. Their posts demonstrate how easy it is to get up and running with a Quarto blog!\nInspired by their words, there is no better time to start writing. So consider this a first introduction. I am setting the intention to post monthly to this blog."

I consider myself a beginning to intermediate level R user. To help me retain the information I’m learning, I will try to blog everything that seems worth sharing. I hope that these help you, if you are trying to learn more about R like I am.\nI don’t want my posts to be exclusive to R. Like any tool, the language has its strengths and weaknesses. I will likely include some content on PowerBI and perhaps its integration with R. I also want to document notable takeaways from my experiences in graduate school and other projects I am involved with in my professional work."

    "text": "This post is intended to demonstrate some basic ways to map data in R. For our example, we will be creating a choropleth map of Michigan’s counties featuring COVID-19 data. The result is something quite similar to the map featured on the state’s dashboard. The data used in this post is from October 4, 2022.\nFor the sake of practice, we will walk through two different ways to go about this process. First we will use ggplot2. We will use a function called map_data to pull in shape file data easily. In our second example, we will use leaflet to create a better looking version of this map and use a raw shape file."

    "text": "So who am I?\nMy name is Brenden Smith. At this point, I am a little over a year into my graduate studies. I attend Michigan State University and I am working towards my Master in Public Health. I am most interested in data analysis, visualization, community-engaged research, and health disparities.\nPublic health as a field can be very broad. By its very nature, the field is multidisciplinary and covers a wide array of topics. I come from primarily a policy background. I received my Bachelor of Arts in social relations and policy from James Madison College (also here at MSU). My senior seminar was focused on US health care and policy and pretty much ever since I’ve been interested in a career in PH.\nDuring my undergrad I was also introduced to R for the first time in a quantitative methods course. That introduction began my interest in the programming language. More recently I have discovered the tidyverse and shiny packages. It is so exciting to be a part of the open-source community. I hope to contribute to it as I have most definitely benefited from the wealth of knowledge already available on the internet."

    "text": "Ggplot2 map\nTo start, we will make a base map with ggplot2 and make it interactive with plotly. First, as always, we load in the libraries we will be using.\n\n# Load packages -----------------------------------------------------------\nlibrary(tidyverse) # really just dplyr but the whole verse can't hurt\nlibrary(openxlsx) # to read in excel data\nlibrary(plotly) # for the interactive part\nlibrary(RColorBrewer) # to set our color palette\n\nNext, we will get our county map. To do this we can simply call the function map_data and specify that we want it at the county level. This will give us data for every county in the US. Because we are only mapping Michigan, we add a second line to subset our first data frame ‘counties’ to only include Michigan.\n\n# Make the base state map -------------------------------------------------\ncounties <- map_data(\"county\")\nmi_county <- subset(counties, region == \"michigan\")\n\nFor our COVID-19 data, I am importing an older file from state’s website (linked previously). If you want a current version to follow along, you can find it there. Once the file is loaded into R Studio, we need to make a few adjustments. The original file splits the cases into two categories, confirmed and probable. On the state’s dashboard, they combine these numbers into a total for map reporting. We will do the same. This is easily done with the group_by and summarise functions. We will also change the county names to lowercase in preparation for merging.\n\n# Data prep ---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nmicovid <- read.xlsx(\"Cases and Deaths by County 2022-10-04.xlsx\")\n\nmicovid <- micovid %>%\n  group_by(COUNTY) %>%\n  summarise(total_cases = sum(Cases),\n            total_deaths = sum(Deaths)) %>%\n  ungroup() %>%\n  mutate(subregion = tolower(COUNTY))\n\ncases_and_county <- inner_join(mi_county, micovid, by = \"subregion\")\ncases_and_county <- cases_and_county %>%\n  rename(county = COUNTY)\n\n\ncases_and_county<- cases_and_county %>%\n  mutate(Category = case_when(total_cases < 1000 ~ '0-999', \n                              total_cases < 5000 ~ '1000-4999',\n                              total_cases <15000 ~ '5000-14999',\n                              total_cases < 30000 ~ '15000-29999',\n                              total_cases < 100000~ '30000-99999',\n                              total_cases < 1000000 ~ '100000+',\n                              TRUE ~ 'NA'))\n\ncases_and_county$Category <- as.factor(cases_and_county$Category)\n\nlvls <- c('0-999', \n          '1000-4999',\n          '5000-14999',\n          '15000-29999',\n          '30000-99999',\n          '100000+')\n\ncases_and_county$Category <- fct_relevel(cases_and_county$Category, lvls)\n\n\n# Making the map ----------------------------------------------------------\n\np <- c(\"#ACD1E7\", \"#82BADC\", \"#59A1CF\", \"#236893\",\"#174562\", \"#122548\")\n\nlabel <- list(\n  bgcolor = \"#EEEEEE\",\n  font = list(color = \"black\")\n)\n\nnoax <- list(\n  title = \"\",\n  zeroline = FALSE,\n  showline = FALSE,\n  showticklabels = FALSE,\n  showgrid = FALSE\n)\n\ng <- cases_and_county %>%\n  ggplot(aes(long, lat, \n                group = group,\n                text = paste('</br>County:', county, '</br>Category:', Category,\n                             '</br>Cases:', total_cases)))+\n  geom_polygon(colour = alpha(\"black\", 1/2), fill = NA) +\n  geom_polygon(data = cases_and_county, colour = \"black\", aes(fill = Category))+\n  theme_void() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = p) \n\n\nggplotly(g, tooltip = c(\"text\"), width = 700, height = 600) %>%\n  layout(xaxis = noax,\n         yaxis = noax) %>%\n  style(hoverlabel = label) %>%\n  config(displayModeBar = FALSE)"

    "text": "This past semester, I had the pleasure of taking a course on health informatics. We were tasked with creating an entire interactive dashboard using Power BI. This is my first experience using the software, and I have to say it is a lot of fun to play around with. After learning some of the ins and outs of exporting and transforming data, formatting beautiful visualizations came surprisingly easy.\nThe dashboard featured here is a re-imagining of the State’s current COVID-19 dashboard. I began with recreating the content they already provide. This entire project was made using the publicly available data files on the SOM’s website. In the last tab, I incorporated the CDC’s community level data that they provide for each state. I included this as the data provided is made comparable by population standardization, and increasingly, it seems that officials are looking to these levels specifically for policy guidance.\nTo view the dashboard in full screen you can use the link here. Below is the embedded dashboard. Enjoy!"
