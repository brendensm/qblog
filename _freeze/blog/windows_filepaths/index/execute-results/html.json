This has led me to learn about the subtle differences when using R on different operating systems.\n\nIf you are like me, you probably work with a team and handle confidential data. Many workplaces use network drives to store data securely. Often in my day-to-day work, I use files with increasingly complex file paths and read them into RStudio. If you are familiar with this process, you likely know how particular R can be about file path formatting.\n\nR prefers file paths to be separated by forward slashes `/`. The default file paths in Windows, however, use backward slashes `\\`. You *could* manually change each backward slash to a forward slash, *or* add another backward slash so that each folder is separated by two slashes. While both options work most of the time, if you do this often enough, there's a more efficient solution!\n\n## A Function to Simplify Your Workflow\n\nTo avoid this hassle, I use a custom function to quickly import and format my file paths:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# install.packages(\"clipr\")\ncopied_path <- function(){\n  out <- clipr::read_clip() # or readClipboard on Windows\n  out <- gsub(\"^\\\"|\\\"$\", \"\", out)\n # out <- gsub(\"\\\\\\\\\", \"/\", out)\n  clipr::write_clip(out) # writeClipboard(out)\n  message(\"The formatted path has been copied to your clipboard.\")\n  return(out)\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: callout-note\nI am using functions from the R package `clipr` because I wrote this blog post on a MacBook Air. On a Windows machine, I would use the functions `readClipboard` and `writeClipboard` from the `utils` package to avoid an additional dependency.\n:::\n\nLet's say I have a complex file path like this: \"my\\\\file\\\\is\\\\in\\\\here\\\\somewhere.txt\". I would first copy this to my clipboard from the file explorer. On a Windows machine, this copies the full path including quotation marks. When we run our function in the console, the following occurs:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncopied_path()\n```\n:::\n\n\n![](cp_output.jpg)\n\nThis returns the neatly formatted file path and automatically copies it to your clipboard, saving you time and effort.\n\n## How the Function Works\n\nIn R, we can read what is copied to our clipboard. This is the first step in our function. We can call it as a string using the following command:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nout <- clipr::read_clip()\n# or readClipboard() on Windows\n```\n:::\n\n\nWhen we copy a file path from the file explorer on a Windows machine, it includes quotation marks. Therefore, the next step is to remove these from the string using regex:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nout <- gsub(\"^\\\"|\\\"$\", \"\", out)\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe can then replace double back slashes with a forward slash. If we don't do this, the string copied to our clipboard will retain single back slashes:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nout <- gsub(\"\\\\\\\\\", \"/\", out)\n```\n:::\n\n\nFor the final step, we copy the new string to the clipboard, send a message to the console, and return the new string:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n  clipr::write_clip(out) # writeClipboard(out)\n  message(\"The formatted path has been copied to your clipboard.\")\n  return(out)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Another Alternative\n\nIf you are using R version 4.0.0 or later, you also have the option of [using a raw string constant](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14185287/escaping-backslash-in-string-or-paths-in-r/14185627#14185627). This is done by wrapping your text with `r\"()\"`. This will return a string with double back slashes:\n\n![](r.jpg)\n\n\n<button onclick=\"loadApp()\" class=\"btn btn-primary\" id=\"loadButton\" style=\"background:#685068;\">Subscribe to my Newsletter!</button>\n\n<div id=\"myapp\"></div>\n\n<script>\nlet isLoaded = false;\n\nfunction loadApp() {\n  const container = document.getElementById(\"myapp\");\n  const button = document.getElementById(\"loadButton\");\n  \n  if (!isLoaded) {\n    // Create and add the iframe\n    const iframe = document.createElement('iframe');\n    iframe.src = \"https://n1mbmu-brenden-smith.shinyapps.io/listserv/\";\n    iframe.width = \"100%\";\n    iframe.height = \"275px\";\n    iframe.style.border = \"none\";\n    container.appendChild(iframe);\n    button.textContent = \"Hide App\";\n    isLoaded = true;\n    container.style.display = \"block\";\n  } else {\n    // Toggle visibility of existing iframe\n    if (container.style.display === \"none\") {\n      container.style.display = \"block\";\n      button.textContent = \"Hide App\";\n    } else {\n      container.style.display = \"none\";\n      button.textContent = \"Subscribe to my Newsletter!\";\n    }\n  }\n}\n</script>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
